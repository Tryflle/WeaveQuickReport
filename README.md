# WeaveQuickReport
QuickReport (https://github.com/varun7654/QuickReport/) rewritten for weave.

# Commands
1. - `/qr <player>` | Reports players on Hypixel for all reasons and notifies you if they are in your game. (Case sensitive, sorry. Also don't report yourself.)
2. - `/qrclear` | Clears list of reported players.
3. - `/qrpl` | Adds a player to the list of reported players without actually reporting them.
4. - `/qrdebug` | For me trying to figure out why my terrible code does not work.
5. - `/autododge` | Experimental autododge. Has issues on Hypixel, where it's intended to be used for whatever reason.
