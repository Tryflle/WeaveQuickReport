# WeaveQuickReport
Speed up reports on Hypixel with Weave! Inspired by QuickReport (https://github.com/varun7654/QuickReport/).

## Commands
- `/qr <player>` | Reports players on Hypixel for all reasons and notifies you if they are in your game. (Case sensitive, sorry. Also don't report yourself.)
- `/qrclear` | Clears list of reported players.
- `/qrpl` | Adds a player to the list of reported players without actually reporting them.
- `/qrdebug` | For me trying to figure out why my terrible code does not work.
- `/autododge` | Experimental autododge. Works on Hypixel now!
